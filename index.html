        <h2>Music's Introduction to Animated Film</h2>
        <!-- Post Content -->
        <p class="lead">If you have ever watched a movie by Disney, you are likely familiar with the plethora of catchy, story-driven music that accompanies the film. It is hard to talk about Disney’s rendition of the classic fairy tale, “The Little Mermaid” without remembering the iconic “Under the Sea” track that alone went on to win the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1989 as well as the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media in 1991. </p>

        <div style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
        <p class="lead col-xl-9 disney-text">Winning awards is no outlying situation for Disney as many of the musical tracks in their tales have gone on to win awards such as, “Beauty and the Beast (1991)” receiving Oscars for Original Score and Original Song, Aladdin’s “A Whole New World”  taking the Oscar for Best Original Song, The Lion King’s (1994) “Can You Feel the Love Tonight” winning the award for Original Song, Pocahontas’ (1995) “Colors of the Wind” winning the Oscar for Best Original Song, etc, etc. The point is, Disney has a good track record of creating accompanying music for their films that moves audiences and holds value.</p>

        <p class="lead">Walt Disney however, was not a composer, songwriter or anything of the sort. He was an entertainment visionary who knew, 
          <blockquote class="blockquote" style="border: black double; background-color: #006199cc; box-shadow: 12px 12px 5px 1px rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.267);">
          <p class="mb-0 quotes">“There's a terrific power to music. You can run any of these pictures and they'd be dragging and
            boring, but the minute you put music behind them, they have life and vitality they don't get any other way.” -Walt Disney</p>
        </blockquote> </p>

        <p class="lead">Disney knew that the key to reaching wide audiences and the key to success in telling stories through film was to add more than just plot. Disney's films aimed to add something “magical” to enchant the audience. They ended up using music to create a sense of wonder as well as basing thier tales on already wonderous texts, fairy tales. Disney believed in this philosophy so much, their first major feature film was based on the Brothers Grimm fairy tale “Snow White and the Seven Dwarves (1937)” and was created as a musical. This was revolutionary at the time as the first cartoon with synchronized audio and full color was debuted only 5 years prior with Disney’s own “Flowers and Trees.” </p>

        </div>

        <p class="lead">Snow White and the Seven Dwarves used musical aspects in the film as well as plot devices to further the story and give life to the tale. This strategy of creating entertaining musicals disguised as fairy tales paid off for Disney as the film was the highest grossing film of 1938. This was the first sign of the big impact Disney was to have on fairy tales and the animated film industry.</p>

        <br>
        <h2>Disney Before Fairytales</h2>

        <p class="lead">Even though today’s colorful animation and brilliant soundtracks seem commonplace in animated films, it was Disney who revolutionized the film industry by introducing new technology to the animation world. “In 1928, The Jazz Singer, was the first “talking picture.”... That same year, Walt Disney Studios produced Steamboat Willie which introduced the world to animation with a synchronized soundtrack.” (Boom Box Post) Even without the use of dialogue, this new approach to animation was an instant hit, “It was so widely viewed that the term “mickey mousing” quickly came to be synonymous with closely choreographed on-screen action and sound.” (Boom Box Post).</p>

          <p>Steamboat Willie (1928)</p>
        </div>

        <p class="lead">This film was followed by “The Skeleton Dance” which applied the same storytelling principles present in "Steamboat Willie". The films used synchronized sound in the form of music accompanyment and fluid animation to tell a story that is captivating and enjoyable. As Disney wanted more than to tell stories through music, they also began using synchronized sound as a way of introducing dialogue in their film “The Karnival Kid”. In this film, Disney experimented with rough dialogue and it was also the film in which Mickey Mouse says his first words, "Hot Dog". This was not enough for Disney however, as they felt that they needed to bring life to films through vibrant colors.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="lead">Only 4 years after the release of "Steamboat Willie" Disney released “Silly Symphonies: Flowers and Trees” which became the first full-color cartoon using the latest and greatest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technicolor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">technicolor</a> technology. This film, (which you can watch by clicking the video in the first section) used the colors of nature, imagination of animation, and the joy of music to create a piece that without words, tells an engaging and climactic story.</p>

        <p class="lead">It was through Disney’s successful experimentation with new animation techniques and technologies that allotted Disney the money to put aside a budget of 250 thousand dollars to create their first animated feature film based on classic fairy tale, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_White_and_the_Seven_Dwarfs_(1937_film)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Snow White and the Seven Dwarves”</a>. This estimation was evident to be undercutting the cost of creating the film as the film’s overall production costs ballooned to 1.5 million dollars and Walt Disney had to mortgage his home to pay for production of the film. Although the creation of the film came with many hardships, the film proved to be a worthwhile investment for the company as the film became “the highest grossing film of 1938, earning more than $5 million in the first year of its release (Nugent, “This Disney Whirl” 5)” and grossed almost $10 million dollars total in the box office. This newfound confidence in their creative ideas allowed Disney to continue profiting off of reimagined theatrical releases of old tales.</p>
        
        <br>
        <h2>Reimagining A Genre</h2>

        <p class="lead">After the astounding success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, Disney knew they had a winning formula. Take an original fairy tale, add colorful animation, a good soundtrack, and you have the audience's attention. As fairy tales were already popular in their respective countries and communities textually, reimagining tales for a wider western audience with more entertainment and production value only proved to be a success.</p>
        
        <p class="lead">In the years that followed, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Disney_animated_films_based_on_fairy_tales" target="blank">Disney produced dozens of movies and animated shorts reimagined from fairy tales,</a> all including a one-of-a-kind soundtrack and imaginative visuals. Disney aimed to reimagine the fairy tale and update its conventions to include elements more complex than those found in text. They wanted to use the new technologies of the time to create a one of a kind experience retelling critically acclaimed old tales through a new reimagining of the fairy tale genre.</p>
        
        <blockquote class="blockquote"
          style="border: black double; background-color: #006199cc; box-shadow: 12px 12px 5px 1px rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.267);">
          <p class="mb-0 quotes">"We should set a new pattern, a new way to use music. Weave it into the story so somebody doesn't just burst into song.” -Walt Disney</p>
        </blockquote>
    
        

        <p class="lead">This new way of presenting the classic fairytale stuck with many production studios as Disney had created new conventions for the fairy tale genre and in turn gave it a new life. In the same way the fairytale genre was given new conventions in the transition from oral to textual, Disney was creating their own conventions in transitioning the fairy tale from textual to visual and musical.</p>
        
        
        <div>
          <p class="lead col-md-6" style="display: inline-block;">Recent feature films like “Shrek” that have many fairy tale conventions and would be classified as a
            traditional fairy tale, also share the conventions of a Disney reimagined fairy tale. It starts off joking about fairy
            tales and their elements of fantasy, then immediately busts into the song “All Stars” by Smash Mouth for the opening
            credits and scenes. This shows that although the movie is making fun of the conventions present in fairy tales, it cannot help but adopt the entertaining new conventions set in place by Disney. This scene is instantly recognizable and widely popular boasting 25 million views on youtube for
            this two minute clip alone. Although Shrek is mostly a parody on films like those created by Disney, it unironically
            uses conventions set by Disney movies. In seek of money and fame, Walt Disney brought a new height of popularity to
            old classics while also reinventing the genre and giving fairy tales a new colorful and musical medium to thrive in.

        <p class="lead">Disney chose to use the plot and the music in tandem to create films that not only kids could
          annoyingly sing songs of in the back of the car, but also films that can relate to everyone and be joyous for all walks
          of life. Disney took the genre of the textual fairytale and made it modern. They took the cutting edge ways to present
          a fictional story through colorful animation and the beloved culture of musicals to present to the audience a new
          experience that they could categorize as distinctly different in a way only Disney could present at the time.</p>
